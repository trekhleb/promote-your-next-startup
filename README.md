## Use Advanced Google Search Techniques

Google supports [powerful search techniques](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) that may help you to promote your resource.

### Find sites linking to competitors

Find sites linking to your competitors and try to add your link to that web-sites as well.

Google’s `link:` operator was officially deprecated in 2017.  But it does still return some results.

_It might be a good idea to exclude competitor web-site itself from the search results by using the `site:` operator to avoid displaying of internal links_

Do the following Google search but with you competitor's URL:

`link:https://competitor-domain.com/blog -site:competitor-domain.com`

### Find guest post opportunities

This allows you to find web-sites where you might submit the article about your new project/product/startup.

Pick your niche keyword (i.e. `programming`) and Google search for guest post related phrases like so:

 `programming intitle:"write for us" inurl:"write-for-us"`
 
 You can also use other phrases like:
 
 - `contribute to`
 - `become a contributor`
 - `guest post guidelines`
 - `inurl:guest-post`
 - etc.
 
 You can also search for many of these at once:
 
`programming ("write for us" | inurl:"guest-post-guidelines" | inurl:"guest-post")`

Or even:

`(programming | machine learning) AND ("write for us" | inurl:"guest-post-guidelines")`

### Find resource page opportunities

Resource pages contains the links to best resources on specific topic.

It might be a good idea to pitch your resource for inclusion.

To find resource pages you might do the following Google search:

`programming (intitle:"resources" | inurl:resources)`

Or you might narrow it down to:

`intitle:programming AND intitle:resources AND inurl:resources`

### Find more related resource

Once you found a good web-site to place a link to you might want to find similar relevant resources.

To do so just do the following Google search but with the resource you're interested in:

`related:https://news.ycombinator.com`
